General QA application
===========================

This example application, derived from the Voter Benchmark provides support for various QA tasks. 

ant targets
-----------

ant (default)       : compile all Java clients and stored procedures, build the catalog, and start the server

ant server          : start the server

ant rejoin          : start the server and performs a node rejoin - you must specify the node to rejoin with an
                      additional command line parameter in the form: -Dhost=hostname
                      - Purpose: cluster resiliency validation

ant jiggle          : start the client, more than 1 client is permitted.
                      - Purpose: support for generic load simulations

ant wait-s          : starts the single-partition wait client - this client simulates logn-running single-partition
                      requests.
                      - Purpose: support for rejoin & admin mode operations under load

ant wait-m          : starts the multi-partition wait client - this client simulates logn-running multi-partition
                      requests.
                      - Purpose: support for rejoin & admin mode operations under load

ant export          : starts the ExportToFile client
                      - Purpose: export client validation

ant srccompile      : compiles the source code

ant catalog         : build the catalog

ant clean           : remove compiled files, log, etc.
